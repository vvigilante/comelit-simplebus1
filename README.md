# Comelit Simplebus 1 compatible smart audio intercom
If you live in an older building with an audio-only door phone based on the SimpleBus version 1, you may have no choice for upgrading to a smart alternative. This project aims to build an open implementation of a smart doorphone compatible with the comelit simplebus 1 audio protocol, to replace ordinary units such as 2408w/a, 2708W and 2xx8W in general.
