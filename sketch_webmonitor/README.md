A web interface that:
- shows the bus status (clear / busy in a call, etc)
- logs the messages received on the bus
- allows to start a call to an internal unit
- shows the waveform read from the bus
- plays the waveform in real time through the browser

TODO:
- [ ] Wiring diagram (coming)
- [ ] The ADC+DAC is configured to return a mono 16 bit 8KHz signal, but the actual audio is pitched one octave lower, altough with correct speed. I suspect the ADC is lying on the format.
